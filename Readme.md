## About the mini projects
There are four mini games.
1. [Guess the Number](https://github.com/br1anu/interactive_programming_in_python/blob/master/guess-the-number-game.py)
2. [Stop the watch](https://github.com/br1anu/interactive_programming_in_python/blob/master/stopwatch-game.py)
3. [Rock paper scissors lizard spock](https://github.com/br1anu/interactive_programming_in_python/blob/master/rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock-game.py)
4. [Pong](https://github.com/br1anu/interactive_programming_in_python/blob/master/pong-game.py)

You can simply paste the code into this platform [codeskulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org) to run the games. 

Have fun!
